04-simple_java: simple Java with replace
05-simple_java: simpla Java, 2nd version, with replace
06-addHook:     testing hook adding, with replace; Renamed 01 -> 06-addHook

NEEDS RENAMING AND DOC UPDATES:
05 - simple addHook test in default text mode (05.in 05.out)
06 - C-preprocessor-like behaviour in (La)TeX (06.in 06.out)
     using addHook with changing evaluate function
07 - test of Makefile mode (07_Makefile.in 07_Makefile.out)
08 - (08_Makefile.in 08_Makefile.out)
09 - (09_html.in 09_html.out)

2 - simple test, variable testing (2.in 2.out)
3 - repeated test 2 (3.in 3.out)
4 - (4.in 4.out)
6 - (6.in 6.out)
8 - (8.in 8.out)

9 - (9_java.in 9_java.out)
